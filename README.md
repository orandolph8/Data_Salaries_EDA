# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Data Science Salaries

Data science is a rapidly growing field, and Data Scientists play a crucial role in analyzing and interpreting large volumes of data. As this profession becomes increasingly in demand, it is important to understand the factors that may influence Data Scientists' salaries. This analysis focuses on investigating these factors and their impact on salaries.
## II. Data Wrangling

The **Data Wrangling** process involves cleaning and organizing the dataset to ensure its suitability for analysis. Checking for missing values and transforming variables are essential steps in preparing the data for meaningful exploration.

## III. Feature Engineering
To enhance the analysis, **Feature Engineering** is used to create new job category groups to enhance analysis.  I also applied inflation rates to get more accurately representative salary values when making comparisons

## IV. Univariate Analysis
**Univariate Analysis** focuses on individual variables, offering insights into their distributions, central tendencies, and variability.

## V. Multivariate Analysis
**Multivariate Analysis** explores relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.

## VI. Geographic Analysis
**Geographic Analysis** investigates the impact of location on data science salaries. Regional trends and variations are explored to provide a nuanced understanding of how geographical factors contribute to salary differentials and job categories.

## VII. Recommendations
Drawing from the insights gained through rigorous analysis, this section offers **Recommendations** for professionals in the data science field. These recommendations may include insights into what can be done to dig deeper using this data set and what other information may be useful for further analysis.

This EDA project serves as a valuable resource for data science enthusiasts, professionals, and hiring managers seeking a comprehensive understanding of salary trends in the dynamic field of data science. The findings presented here aim to inform strategic decision-making and facilitate informed choices for both job seekers and employers in the data science domain.
